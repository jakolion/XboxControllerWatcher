## Xbox Controller Watcher

Because of a missing battery level indicator of the Xbox One Controller when connected to a PC, the "Xbox Controller Watcher" is a tool for monitoring the battery level. It shows a popup when the controller gets connected, disconnected or if the battery level changes. If the battery level changes to low or empty the popup will stay until it is clicked or the battery level changes to medium or full.
