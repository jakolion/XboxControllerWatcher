## Xbox Controller Watcher

The *Xbox Controller Watcher* is monitoring a connected Xbox Controller and has two tasks:

1. Battery Level

    Because of a missing battery level indicator of the Xbox One Controller when connected to a PC, the *Xbox Controller Watcher* monitors the battery level. It shows a popup when the controller gets connected, disconnected or if the battery level changes.
    
    If the popup is shown while a fullscreen application is running, the popup might not be visible to the user. Therefore the popup will stay on the screen if the battery level changes to low or empty. Then the user is able to see the popup when exiting the fullscreen application.

2. Hotkeys

    Additionally the *Xbox Controller Watcher* monitors hotkeys pressed on the controller. The user can define custom hotkeys and the corresponding commands.
